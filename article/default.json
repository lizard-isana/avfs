The ISS is a 'view point' to share with people all over the world, transcending national boundaries. Sharing one view point from space concurrently would be help us think of our planet together.<br/><br/>â€Ž<em>The first day or so we all pointed to our countries. The third or fourth day we were pointing to our continents. By the fifth day, we were aware of only one Earth.</em><br/>- Sultan bin Salman Al-Saud / Astronaut"
