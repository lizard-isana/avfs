Visualization of earth science data from the view point of iss

3D Globe + Current position of International Space Station + Social Media

The challenge is to develop a 3D satellite tracking system of International Space Station with mapped various earth science data and to share it via social media such as Twitter, Facebook, etc. The ISS is a "view point" to share with people all over the world, transcending national boundaries. Sharing one view point from space concurrently would be help us think of our planet together.
